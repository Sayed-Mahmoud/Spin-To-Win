# Spin To Win

# Offbeateg Task

# Software Developer Task

You are required to create a spin and win application, the wheel will contain 8 items, the
quantities for those items needs to be dynamic , using json or config file or even a separate
window that opens before the app or anything that you see fit.
When the user clicks a button or on the wheel, the wheel needs to rotate and then stop on an
item using weighted random based on the quantity available.
You don’t need to make the wheel rotate depending on the swipe gesture or direction, one
direction will suffice.
Feel free to use any technology to develop this , but we prefer Windows Foundation Framework
(WPF) or Unity3d.
You will find the artwork attached whether you can use it or not , it's up to you.
